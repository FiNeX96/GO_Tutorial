## Setup 

To install the GO programming language, refer to the official tutorial [here](https://go.dev/doc/install).

After installing, to check if everyone works fine you can complete the [Getting Started Guide](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/getting-started).

After this, you can clone this repository into your computer!

## Tutorial overview

We will start of with a theoretical introduction to the language, its main features and uses.

After this, we will go through some basic examples of GO code, and explain the syntax and how it works.

Finally, we will go through some more advanced examples, and explain how to use some features of the GO standard library.

## Exercises

This exercises are made to help you get used to the GO syntax and features.
If you need help, feel free to ask us!

### Basic

This exercises are designed to help you get used to the GO syntax and basic features, such as variables, functions, arrays and so on.

In this folder you already have a go module created, so you can start coding right away!

If you want to know how to create one yourself, its easy, just do:

go init mod <module_name>

Each file in this folder has a explanation of the corresponding feature and then some exercises for you to practice.

### Intermediate

After learning the basics, we will move on to a bit harder exercises, this time they're more algorithmic exercises, to help you get used to the GO syntax and features.

As in the Basic section, you already have a go module created, so you can start coding right away!
